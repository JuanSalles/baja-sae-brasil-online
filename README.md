# Baja SAE Brasil Online

This is a public repository for the website https://bajasaebrasil.net

The code is highly incomplete, but works for now xD

There is legacy code here and there. The major revamp uses Propel for database management, and formulas are read from the database instead of being hard-coded.

Feel free to ask for help and/or contribute :)
